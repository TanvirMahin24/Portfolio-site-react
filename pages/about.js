                  My name is Filip Jerga and I am an experienced software
                  engineer and freelance developer.{" "}
                </p>
                <p>
                  I have a Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence and
                  several years of experience working on a wide range of
                  technologies and projects from C++ development for ultrasound
                  devices to modern mobile and web applications in React and
                  Angular.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Throughout my career, I have acquired advanced technical
                  knowledge and the ability to explain programming topics
                  clearly and in detail to a broad audience. I invite you to
                  take my course, where I have put a lot of effort to explain
                  web and software engineering concepts in a detailed, hands-on
                  and understandable way.
